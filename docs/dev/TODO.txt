ADMIN:
   
   checktimeout
   entity dropdowns
   listview column width
   form control lower case names
   transaction required
   multiname list / \ . consistently
++ move instance file under LOG file group
   redirects use function to get url
   create nodes wizard
++ federation create form databaseversion target server version
   go to the appropriate tab
   review all redirects
   catch and log exceptions from web sites
   highlight fields acception expressionproperties
   convert numbers to some kind of byteproperty
   add system flag to autogenerated entities
   fix and upgrade slicing wizard
   nice entity cacheing
   refresh properties after button click
   add node wizard that creates TEMP and mirrors DBs
   special button: change deployment and running state
   reset lock from admin
   override delete when candelete is false
   database definition running/stoped button isn't working correctly
   do deep copy of entity references when cloning
   
Validation checks
   check for autogrow files
   check for default tempdb
   
Activities

-- Assembly loader: implement correct dll version checking
-- Solve problem of dll locking
   temp database clean-up job
+  job cancel logic to clean up temp tables
++ initialize job objects on deserialization
   
LIB

   buffered logging
   
   try dropping temp table before creating otherwise retry doesn't work
++ replace database server type to .net provider name
   
PARSER
	add resolved, normalized etc flags to selectstatement, queryspecification etc.
   
TESTS

   Test all exception classes for serialization/deserialization (as req'd by the scheduler!)
	
SKYQUERY
	
   number of partitions multiplier is a job setting
++ unit test for query factories
   command line installer to create jobs etc.


SCHEDULER

++ locking collision on job submit when scheduler is active - use lower isolation on web
++ cannot cancel executing jobs when locked by scheduler
++ write test to serialize workflows, there's a bug somewhere


REFACTOR

-- factor out plug-in support from jobs and make it more generic (PlugIns namespace?) - serializers & inherited types
-- Context -> RegistryContext
-- Create SMO context and close SMO connection, start by renaming GetSmoServer



BUGS:

++ sometimes schemamanager doesn't find table while it's certainly there
++ table peek
++ schema  manager breaks if table in session deleted
++ job list brakes if job classes change - go back to xmlserializer


REMOTE SERVICE:
   make app domain management common
   solve assembly loading and versioning problems
   try to time-out hosts and add versions to services
   does it use .net serializer?
   make authorization global for all function


WEB:
++ text from html files
++	copyright
++	contact
++	personnel
++	help
   schema browser: move columns to the details page
   email sender form
   highligh active module in menu
   table schema editor
++ button event fired twice?
   save query before navigating from page
   merge jobdescriptionfactory w/ webjobinstancefactory
++ user activation form and confirmation form are not centered
++ sign-out broken
++ account settings broken
++ register button on login screen causes validation and breaks
++ sign in with email address
++ sign in link points to wrong address (auth instead of gwauth)
   
REGISTRY:
   


SKYQUERY:
   validation
       only tables in xmatch (views cannot have zoneindex)
       check if target table is empty
       error expression requires min and max!
